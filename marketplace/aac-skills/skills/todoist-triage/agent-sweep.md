# Agent sweep — tasks an agent could do

Disclosed reference for [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) steps 3 and 4. Dan, 2026-09-30: triage "should also sweep todoist for anything that can be done by an agent … and ask me if it should be done by an agent on my day board".

## Which tasks

Everything open in scope (Dan, 2026-09-30: "more than just the do tasks. my todoist inbox. everything really"): Current Work, the backlog and the Inbox, whatever the ball — `do`, a direct, `chase`, or none yet. Skip only:

- `no-sweep`, `merged`, and anything in Wontfix;
- a task already carrying `agent` or `no-agent` — Dan has answered it;
- a not-work Inbox item — it stays untouched, per step 2;
- a task this run deletes or merges in tier 1;
- the directs' shared projects — O3 agenda lists, read for context only (Scope).

## The test

A task is agent-doable when all three hold. Read the source thread to its last message first, as for any ruling.

1. **The deliverable is a thing, not an act.** A draft (email or Teams reply, memo, SOP, contract package, report), a research answer, a data pull, a spreadsheet or document, code or a ticket in an AAC repo, a Todoist cleanup.
2. **The inputs are reachable from a session** — the source thread, Drive or SharePoint files, Zoho, Todoist, the repositories — and the task or its source names them.
3. **Nothing in it needs a person.** No decision, approval, signature, payment, phone call, meeting or site visit, and nothing sent under anyone's name. An agent drafts; a person sends.

A task that is part judgment, part legwork qualifies for the legwork only: the question names that half, and the ball holder keeps the rest.

Not sure it passes? Leave it out. Every wrong candidate costs Dan a click.

## Ask — always tier 2

Never applied without asking. One card per task, never two: two cards would each replace the task's labels from a stale copy.

The question names what the agent would produce, from which inputs, and the skill it would use where one fits (`aac-contract-package`, `aac-sop`, `research`, `aac-house-writing-standard` for anything another person reads). One clause each.

Options are in `update-tasks` vocabulary. Labels are a full replacement, so every option starts from the task's current labels.

- **A task with no other question this run** gets its own card, ranked after every other tier-2 question, with two options: **An agent does it** (current labels plus `agent`) and **I'll do it** (current labels plus `no-agent`).
- **A task that already has a question this run** keeps that one card and gains two options built from the card's recommended ruling: **Agent: <ruling>** (the ruling plus `agent`) and **Me: <ruling>** (the ruling plus `no-agent`). The card's other options stay as they were and write no agent label; if Dan picks one, the next run asks the agent question on its own card. When the recommended ruling is a delete or a merge, pair the first option that keeps the task instead; when every option deletes or merges, leave the agent question for the next run — the board applies a delete or merge without writing labels.

Every option that writes `agent` says so in its label, so Dan never picks it unknowingly.

The agent does the legwork whoever holds the ball.

On the Day Board this is an ordinary `triage/<taskId>` card per [`day-board.md`](day-board.md) § Publish the run. The board's own **Rule out** button still moves the task to Wontfix — it kills the task, it is not the agent "no" — so the question text names **I'll do it** (or **Me: …**) as the way to keep the task and decline the agent.

An answer that arrives as a note (the board's Note only, the reason typed beside any option, or prose in the session) and declines the agent is still a "no": the run writes `no-agent` on the task itself, then acts on the rest of the note.

## What the labels mean

`agent` and `no-agent` are not ball labels: the ball stays where it was. `agent` says Dan approved the task for an agent; `no-agent` is his "no", landed durably so the sweep never asks again. Either one takes the task out of the sweep for good. Dan removes the label to reopen the question.

This run does not start the agent. An `agent` task waits for a session to pick it up, and the result comes back to the ball holder as a draft or a task comment — never sent, filed or signed by the agent.
